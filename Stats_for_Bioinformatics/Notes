Lecture 5:

Utilizing spike-in control in order to have a standardized amount of DNA

MVA plots

M = log2(E1/E2)

A = E1+E2/2 (average)

Log2 ratio should be centered around 0 if there is no difference between the data sets

How to normalize RNA-seq data? Still to be determined!

Paired Design vs Two Sample

Paired Design is meant to eliminate genetic variation
  - measure same person before and after treatment
  - look at twins

#####

Statistics tests -
parametric tests -
  two sampled t-test - compare each genes expression vs experimental conditions.. are they part of the same distribution?
  paired t test

  two tailed vs one tail? (2x pt if doing 1 sided t-test)

non-parametric test -
  wilcoxon ranked sum test
  wilcoxon test

permutation based testing

Lower expression values are less reliable than higher expression

## NORMALIZE ALL ARRAYS AT THE SAME TIME - IN SAME LINE OF CODE (rma function)


MULTIPLE TESTING-

 FWER=(reject at least one Hypothesis |given all H0 are true)
If we control hypothesis-wise type I error at 0.05 individually, what’s the FWER?
	-- e.g. If test two hypotheses, a1=0.05 a2=0.05
(0.05*0.95)+(0.05*0.95)+(0.05^2)=0.0975
1             2           3

three possibilities :
1 - a1 reject null, a2 cant reject null
2 - a2 reject null, a1 cant reject null
3 - accept both

Benjamini and Hochber 1995

1. sort p values (largest p value at bottom/first to test)
2. define i* pi < (i/n)α (set alpha to .05)
3. reject null hypothesis after i*


FDR

**NOTE** distribution of p-value if null hypothesis is true.
however in differential expression experiments, there is a skew toward lower p-values
this suggests that there is in fact differential gene expression

FDR=m0Pr(p-value<= t|H0)/s(t) = m0t/s(t)

where m0 is number of invariant genes (true null hypotheses).
t is significance threshold you choose

Let p0=m0/m, i.e the proportion
of the true null hypotheses in the
total number of m hypotheses.

under null hypothesis, if λ is a p value from 0-1

what fraction of p values have are larger than λ?

(1-λ)*m0

estimate

m0 = (# pvalues > λ)/1-λ

how to choose lambda???

it is a compromise!!!

########

q-value : probability (H0 is true | observed as or more extreme p-value)
-> more bayesian approach than p-value. more appropriate than for picking genes
-> minimum FDR at which the test may be considered significant


#### Exploratory analysis of microarray data - UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

Classification tasks in microarray data
Similarity measures
Cluster analysis
  - cluster samples
  - cluster genes

big p small n problem
n = sample size
p = variables (each gene is a variable when you cluster genes)

How to cluster? Need distance measure

When are objects similar to one another?

Cluster Algorithms minimize distance within groups or maximize distance between groups

Distance measures:
- Euclidean distance - difference between points in space - MOST OFTEN USED
- Manhattan distance - less sensitive to outliers (absolute distance) LEAST USED
- Correlation distance - how correlated are the samples/genes (can only measure linear relationships)
    - need to use (1 - correlation)

Perform standardization prior to calculating distance (scaling)
  - THIS IS A LINEAR TRANSFORMATION AND DOES NOT CHANGE THE CORRELATION
  - After standardization, euclidean distance and correlation distance are the SAME


Hierarchical Clustering (HCL)
  Bottom up. Find most similar pairs and then go up.
  Vertical branches are the similarity between groups.
  Bottom of tree are most similar.
  Next branch up are closest to the bottom and so on

Need to define some sort of distance
  Average distance - mean distance
  Single Linkage - min distance
  Complete Linkage - max distance

Number of clusters depends on the allowed distance between clusters

Clustering does not show the full picture because you are grouping variables
  Parameters for distance matrix - n(n-1)/2
  Parameters for dendrogram - n-1

Can cluster experiments
  Possible application is diagnosing a disease.

HCL is not robust, small changes can change tree

K-means CLUSTERING -
  Need to pre-specify the number of groups to use for clustering - HOW is below
  MINIMIZE within-cluster variance!!!
    Distance between each point to center of the cluster

  Steps -
    Assign points to cluster whose centroid is closest to the points
    Update centroids by taking average of points within the cluster

  Number of clusters
    - eigenvalues
    - sum of squares
